# Welcome to my blog

Hello there, this is Jason. I graduated from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and now working as a software engineer at [THG](https://www.thg.com/).
I create and contribute to a several of open source projects in my free time. See a list of open source projects that I have created below.

This blog is intended to log down some of the interesting technologies or problems that I encounter. 

This blog is built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). Thanks to [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) for creating [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and all these.

My blog posts are also posted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/ycmjason).
