Here is a story of how we ended up building <a href=\"https://frogram.ycmjason.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frogram<OutboundLink/></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"initial-idea\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#initial-idea\">#</a> Initial Idea</h2>\n<p>The initial idea that me and Anthony had, was to teach the basics of Python; then give out some challenges for the participants to work on, e.g. printing <code>hello world</code> 10 times, solve the quadratic equation etc.</p>\n<p>However, we see two problems with this approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The challenges are not rewarding. There is no incentive for the participants to work on them. Why would they want to print <code>hello world</code> 10 times? They solved the quadratic equation, so what?<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xT77Y36ijyuwn58bja/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"></li>\n<li>It is more like an &quot;Introduction to <em>Python the Programming Language</em>&quot; than an &quot;Introduction to <em>Programming</em>&quot; because the participants are likely to struggle more on language issues, e.g. incorrect indentations, incorrect syntax, rather than logic issues.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"frogger\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#frogger\">#</a> Frogger</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/2WeOD9LfJGY4PN8VSy/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Frogger game\"></p>\n<p>To make the challenge more rewarding, we have this idea of asking the participants to win the Frogger game by writing some code. The code will essentially control the frog. It is obvious that playing games is much more rewarding than printing <code>hello world</code> 10 times.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-frograming-language\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-frograming-language\">#</a> The Frograming Language</h2>\n<p>We invented a frogger-specific language to minimise the time needed for fixing language issues. We want to make the language as minimal and restrictive as possible so that it could provide super helpful error message.</p>\n<p>For example, since the available predicates are limited to only <code>isGoalUp|isRiverUp|is(Car|Log|Wall)(Up|Right|Down|Left)</code>, if the user types <code>isCardown</code> with a lowercase <code>d</code>, the error message generated would be super specific saying: <code>Expected &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Left&quot;, &quot;Right&quot;, or &quot;Up&quot; but &quot;d&quot; found</code>. (Thanks to <a href=\"https://pegjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PEG.js<OutboundLink/></a> for the amazing parser generator!)</p>\n<h2 id=\"frogram-frogger-x-program\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#frogram-frogger-x-program\">#</a> Frogram - Frogger x Program</h2>\n<p>At last, combining the frogger and the frograming language, we have our final <a href=\"https://frogram.ycmjason.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frogram<OutboundLink/></a>! Go ahead now and check it out! Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
